Assembly by connection
Add bc's

Single call for standard conductance formulation
	Assembly using h0 + bc

Two calls for Newton formulation
	C1 with h0
	Q1 = C1h0 + bc1
	
	C2 with h0 + e
	Q2 = C2(h0+e) + bc2
	
	J = (Q1 - Q2) / e


Standard newton
	Jdh = r
	h = h0 + dh

Manipulated newton to solve for h
	Jh = r - Jh0
