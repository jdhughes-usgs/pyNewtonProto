Conductance assembly by connection

Add bc's to diagonal of coefficient matrix (A)
    o Recharge

Assembly options for constant heads:
    1) Maintain connectivity and base conductance for the diagonal and
       off diagonals (like the constant head cell was an active cell).
       Then subtract a big number (1e20) from the diagonal and subtract
       the product of the big number and the specified head. This is what
       Sorab does in MODFLOW-USG. Specific steps:

         Constant head cell:
           o Assemble like an active cell. -sum of conductances in diagonal
             (node_n). Off diagonals (node_m) set to Cn-m.
           o Subtract a big number (1e20) from the diagonal (node_n)
           o Subtract the product of the big number (1e20) and the specified
             head in the connected cell (-1e20 x h(node_m)) from RHS(node_n)

         Active cells connected to a constant head cell
           o Assembled like a connection between two active cells.

    2) Treat a constant head cell as a general-head boundary in active
       cells adjacent to constant head cells. Specific steps:

         Constant head cell:
           o Diagonal (node_n) set to -1
           o RHS(node_n) set to -head(node_n)
           o All off diagonals (node_m) set to zero

         Active cells connected to a constant head cell:
           o Subtract conductance between the active and constant (Cn-m) head
             cells from the diagonal
           o Subtract the product of the conductance and the specified
             head in the connected cell (-Cn-m x h(node_m)) from RHS(node_n)
           o Off diagonal for connection (node_m) set to zero

Single call for standard conductance formulation
	Assembly using h0 + bc

Two calls for Newton formulation
	C1 with h0
	Q1 = C1h0 + bc1
	
	C2 with h0 + e
	Q2 = C2(h0+e) + bc2
	
	J = (Q1 - Q2) / e


Standard newton
	Jdh = -r
	h = h0 + dh

Manipulated newton to solve for h
	Jh = -r - Jh0
